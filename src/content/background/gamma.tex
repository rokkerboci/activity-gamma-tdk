\section{The Gamma Statechart Composition Framework}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Gamma Statechart Composition Framework is a tool created to support platform-independent modeling and heterogeneous development of [system] components. For my purposes, it provides an interface to \emph{design} composite systems and transform them to a verifiable model (XSTS).

Figure \ref{fig:gamma-pipeline} shows an abstract representation of how a \emph{high-level} SysML model could be verified using Gamma as a \emph{middle man}. Important aspect of the transformations is to have back annotations, which provide the user with the information of \emph{which} source model element the verifier returned.
