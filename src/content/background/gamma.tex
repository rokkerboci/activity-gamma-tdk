\section{The Gamma Statechart Composition Framework}\label{sec:gamma}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Gamma Statechart Composition Framework is an integrated
tool to support the design, verification and validation as well as
code generation for component-based reactive systems. The behaviour of each component is captured by a statechart, while assembling the system from components is driven by a domain-specific composition language. Gamma supports formal verification by mapping composite statecharts to a back-end model checker. Execution traces obtained as witnesses during verification are back-annotated as test cases to replay an error trace or to validate external code generators.\cite{molnar2018gamma}.

The workflow of Gamma builds on a model transformation chain depicted in \autoref{fig:gamma-overview}, which illustrates the input and output models of these model transformations as well as the languages in which they are defined, and the relations between them. The modeling languages are as follows.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The \textbf{Gamma Statechart Language (GSL)} is a UML/SysML-based statechart language supporting different semantic variants of statecharts.
	\item The \textbf{Gamma Composition Language (GCL)} is a composition language for the formal hierarchical composition of state-based 	components according to multiple execution and interaction semantics.
	\item The \textbf{Gamma Genmodel Language (GGL)} is a configuration language for configuring model transformations.
	\item The \textbf{Gamma Property Language (GPL)} is a property language supporting the definition properties and thus, the formal specification of requirements regarding (composite)	component behavior.
	\item The \textbf{Gamma Trace Language (GTL)} is a high-level specification language for  execution traces of (composite) components.
\end{itemize}

Optionally, statechart models defined in supported modeling tools (front-ends) can be imported into Gamma (Step 0), which can be integrated according to well-defined execution and interaction semantics (Step 1-2). The resulting composite model is processed and transformed into the input formalisms of integrated model checker back-ends (Step 3). The model checker back-ends provide witnesses (diagnostic traces) based on specified properties, which are back-annotated, resulting in abstract traces (Step 4).
Finally, the abstract traces are mapped into concrete (executable) traces tailored to the targeted execution environment (Step 5). Please note, that this is a summary of the workflow; for more detailed descriptions, see the Appendix and \cite{mixed_statecharts_2020}.
