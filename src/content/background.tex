\chapter{Background}\label{ch:background}

In this chapter I address the foundations of this work. In \autoref{sec:mbse} I introduce concept of model-based systems engineering, which is a well known approach for complex system design. This includes SysML as well (\autoref{ssec:sysml}).  After this I talk about Formal Verification in \autoref{sec:formal_verification}, and introduce Petri nets (\autoref{ssec:petri-net} and a mapping from between activities and Petri nets (\autoref{ssec:activities-as-petri-nets}). Lastly, I introduce the Gamma Composite Statechart Framework, which is a tool for stating and verifying composite models using statechart behaviours\autoref{sec:gamma}, and a low-level formalism created for model checking used by Gamma in \autoref{sec:xsts}.
