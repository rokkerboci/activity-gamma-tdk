In this chapter, I present the theoretical foundations of my contribution. In \autoref{sec:mbse}, I introduce the concept of model-based systems engineering, which is a well-known approach for complex system design. This section also goes into detail about SysML (\autoref{ssec:sysml}), which is a general-purpose modeling language for system design. Next, I talk about the concept of formal verification in \autoref{sec:formal_verification}, and introduce Petri nets (\autoref{ssec:petri-net}) and a mapping between UML/SysML Activity Diagrams and Petri nets (\autoref{ssec:activities-as-petri-nets}). Lastly, I introduce the Gamma Statechart Composition Framework, which is a tool for modeling and verifying component-based reactive systems based on statecharts (\autoref{sec:gamma}), and a low-level formalism called XSTS (\autoref{sec:xsts}) used as an intermediary language for model checking by Gamma.
