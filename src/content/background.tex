\chapter{Background}\label{ch:background}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this chapter I present the foundations of this work. In \autoref{sec:mbse} I introduce the concept of model-based systems engineering, which is a well known approach for complex system design. This section also includes SysML as well (\autoref{ssec:sysml}). Next, I talk about the concept of formal verification in \autoref{sec:formal_verification}, and introduce Petri nets (\autoref{ssec:petri-net}) and a mapping between activities and Petri nets (\autoref{ssec:activities-as-petri-nets}). Lastly, I introduce the Gamma Statechart Composition Framework, which is a tool for stating and verifying composite models using statechart behaviours \autoref{sec:gamma}, and a low-level formalism called XSTS, created for model checking used by Gamma in \autoref{sec:xsts}.
