\section{Implementation Remarks}\label{sec:implementation-remarks}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to implement the language, I had to immerse myself in multiple technologies. Gamma is implemented as an Eclipse plugin\footnote{https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/}, and uses multiple frameworks: Ecore Modeling Foundation\footnote{https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/} to create the metamodels, Xtext\footnote{https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/} to define the language grammars, and Viatra\footnote{https://www.eclipse.org/viatra/} to transform the models.

During the implementation, I added a new \emph{model} project and a new \emph{language} project. I then had to extend the preexisting Gamma Statechart Language, and the transformation pipeline.

The contributions include \(12,383\) line additions, \(2,184\) line deletions in \(38\) commits. There is currently an open pull request to the main GitHub repo\footnote{https://github.com/ftsrg/gamma}.

These changes implemented are visualised in \autoref{fig:gamma-activity-overview}: added parts are outlined with green, while edited parts are outlined with orange.
