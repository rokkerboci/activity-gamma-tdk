\section{XSTS Language Constructs}\label{sec:xsts_language}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this appendix I introduce the exact language constructs for the XSTS language 

\subsection{Types}

XSTS contains two default variable types, logical variables (\emph{boolean}) and mathematical integers (\emph{integer}). Types defined this way make up the domains \(D_{v1}, D_{v2}, \dots, D_{vn}\) introduced in \autoref{def:xsts}. XSTS also allows the user to define \emph{custom types}, similarly to enum types in common programming languages.

A custom type can be declared the following way:

\begin{Verbatim}
	type <name> : { <literal_1>, . . . , <literal_n> }
\end{Verbatim}

Where \(D_{name} = \{ literal_1, \dots, literal_n \}\).

\subsection{Variables}

Variables can be declared the following way, where \verb|<value>| denotes the value that will be assigned to the variable in the initialization vector:

\begin{Verbatim}
	var <name> : <type> = <value>
\end{Verbatim}

Where \(v_{name}\) will be in domain \(D_{type}\).

If the user wishes to declare a variable without an initial value, this is possible as well:

\begin{Verbatim}
	var <name> : <type>
\end{Verbatim}

A variable can be tagged as a control variable with the keyword \verb|ctrl|:

\begin{Verbatim}
	ctrl var <name> : <type>
\end{Verbatim}

In which case the variable \(v\) will also be added to \(V_C\) (the set of control variables).

\subsubsection{Basic operations}

Operations make up the set \(Ops\) introduced in \autoref{def:xsts}. These operations, and their compositions define the behaviour of the XSTS model.

\paragraph{Assume}

An assumption operation can only be executed, if and only if its \emph{expression} evaluates to \emph{true}. This fact means, that if a composite operation contains a \emph{falsy} assumption, the whole composite operation will not fire.

A simple assumption operation can be stated like the following:

\begin{Verbatim}
	assume <expr>
\end{Verbatim}

\paragraph{Assignment}

Assignments have the following syntax, where \verb|<varname>| is the name of a variable and
\verb|<expr>| is an expression of the same type:

\begin{Verbatim}
	<varname> := <expr>
\end{Verbatim}

An assignment operation overwrites the variables value upon execution.

\paragraph{Havoc}

Havocs give the XSTS models randomness, by randomly \emph{assigning} a value.

The syntax of havocs is the following, where \verb|<varname>| is the name of a variable:

\begin{Verbatim}
	havoc <varname>
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Composite operations}

Composite operations give way to building up more complicated transition trees, by providing nesting the already introduced simple operations.

\paragraph{Choice}

Non-deterministic choices work by randomly executing one and only one of its composed operations.

Non-deterministic choices have the following syntax, where \verb|<operation>| are arbitrary basic or composite operations:

\begin{Verbatim}
	choice { <operation> } or { <operation> }
\end{Verbatim}

\paragraph{Sequence}

Sequences execute all composed operations one-by-one from top to bottom.

Sequences have the following syntax:

\begin{Verbatim}
	<operation>
	<operation>
	<operation>
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Transitions}

Each transition is a single operation (basic or composite). We distinguish between three sets of transitions, \emph{Tran}, \emph{Init} and \emph{Env} - associating to the three different operation sets introduced in \autoref{def:xsts}. Transitions are described with the following syntax, where \verb|<transition-set>| is either \verb|tran|, \verb|env| or \verb|init|:

\begin{Verbatim}
	<transition-set> {
		<operation>
	} or {
		<operation>
	} or
	...
	or {
		<operation>
	}
	
\end{Verbatim}
