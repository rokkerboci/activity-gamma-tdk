\section{Language Design}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of GATL is twofold: it should support as many features from SysML activity diagrams as possible, while also having formal semantics. In order to make the transformation easier, the language supports only a constrained subset of the SysML feature set, however, this restriction does not hinder its expressiveness.

\subsection{Supported SysML Feature Subset}

Compared to SysML activity diagrams, GATL supports the following language constructs:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{control} and \emph{data} flows;
	\item \emph{Initial} and \emph{activity final} nodes;
	\item \emph{Decision} and \emph{merge} nodes - without probability;
	\item \emph{Fork} and \emph{join} nodes;
	\item \emph{Action} nodes - which can contain inner activities (Call behaviour in SysML);
	\item \emph{Pins} on action nodes;
	\item \emph{Action} nodes - action nodes may contain specific internal actions\footnote{Written in the Gamma Action Language} that can calculate values, and send signals through specific ports.
\end{itemize}
