\chapter{Integrating Activity Language Into Gamma}\label{ch:activiy_verification}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the previous chapter, I have introduced the Gamma Activity Language - it's formalism and textual representation. However, in order to use it for model verification, it has to be integrated into the Gamma transformation pipeline (see \autoref{fig:gamma-overview}). For this integration, I start by defining \emph{how} it integrates with Gamma in \autoref{sec:activities-alongside-statecharts}, after which I show transformation algorithm in \autoref{sec:activities-as-state-based-models}. Finally, I talk a bit about the implementation details in \autoref{sec:implementation-regards}.
